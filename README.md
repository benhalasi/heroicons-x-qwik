# Heroicons x Qwik

[Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) is great, but it doesn't work with [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) out of the box, this library aims to solve that issue.

## Known Issues / Backlog

Currently the components (icons) provided by the library aren't being suggested by the editor when coding, so it only works with manual importing or some workaround.
